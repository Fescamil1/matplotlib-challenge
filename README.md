# matplotlib-challenge
Python code uses Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze real-world situation and dataset.

### Scenario

 As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. **The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens**. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

#### Bar plot using both Pandas's and Matplotlib's shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study:

#### Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftaminand. Highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style
